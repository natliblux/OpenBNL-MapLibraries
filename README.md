# OpenBNL-MapLibraries
This project makes use of Open Data from the BnL to map the locations of all the libraries in Luxembourg.
## Introduction
This project uses Jupyter Notebooks to encapsulate all information regarding the project.
The notebook retrieves data about all the libraries in Luxembourg using the BnL's Open Data API and then maps them using OpenStreetMaps.
## Requirements
* Developed using Python 3.12
* Folium for mapping the gps coordinates
* Nominatum for retrieving gps coordinates from an address
## Usage
The notebook can be run online using [Binder/JupyterLab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/natliblux/OpenBNL-MapLibraries/6a97f04b06d3f97f443371d166864a4bcc6de87c?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fsrc%2FOpenBnL-MapLibraryLocations.ipynb).
